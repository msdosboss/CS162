identify sections of their code that you think could or should be made into methods or functions:
	This is a pretty small program that does not have very much repeat code. So I do not think there is any code I should put in a
	function or method 

what tests would use to show that their programming is working correctly (or would even break their code:
	I could add a test to check if the area calculations are correct.


If you have these installed, then when you run pydocstyle and pycodestyle on their code, what warnings and errors do you get?

    What do these messages mean?:
	the only message this program generates when running through pydocstyle was a warning about a lack of doc string for 
	fuctions/methods

    In your opinion are the programmerâ€™s style differences from the PEP standards acceptable?:
	I personally think that this is fine because the functions are very small and easy to understand.
