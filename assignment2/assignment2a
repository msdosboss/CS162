Discuss with classmates how you would do the following (and be sure to document your thoughts and submit it with the assignment) to your 
first week's project code:

    how do you think you would add file reading and writing functionality to your first week's project in this class:
	For assignement1.py I could write the attributes of a player object into a json like file that would hold the value of each of the
	attributes. I could have a read method that would fill a player object with information from a file. I could also have a write
	function that would take a player object and writes its attributes to a json like file.

    how do you think the try and except clauses of Python work (based on your current understanding or a quick Internet search) and what the 	FileNotFoundError class is:
	try and except are used when it is possible a command you want to run might cause an error, but you don't want the program to crash
	because of it. For example it could be used if you asked a user for a file to read and they might enter in a file name that does
	not exist.

    identify sections of your code that you could use to create functions or methods out of:
	I don't think there is much repeat code in assignment1.py asside from the maybe the creation of the "godItems" dicationary which 
	happens twice once on line 103 and the other on line 111. Although if I were to refactor that section I would just turn the 
	"godItems" into an array. In an earlier revsion of this code I didn't have the "addItemFromGods" function which meant that I was 
	running that exact same code twice in both the if on line 102 and the else on line 110

    design tests that would show your program working correctly (positive tests and negative tests):
	refer to debugassignment1.py
